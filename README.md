# 📊 SQL Data Analysis Project

This project showcases data exploration and analysis using **Structured Query Language (SQL)**. It involves writing optimized queries to extract insights, perform aggregations, filter datasets, and generate metrics that can support decision-making processes across domains.


---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Demonstrate **proficiency in SQL** for data analysis
- Perform **data cleaning**, **filtering**, and **aggregation**
- Generate **descriptive statistics**, **trends**, and **patterns**
- Apply concepts like **JOINs**, **subqueries**, **window functions**, and **CTEs**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **SQL** (MySQL)
- Data source: CSV / Relational database
- Optional: Data exported for use in Excel / Power BI / Python

---

## 🧪 Key Concepts Used

- `SELECT`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `WHERE`, `HAVING`
- `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `SELF JOIN`
- `CASE WHEN`, `IF()`, conditional logic
- `WINDOW FUNCTIONS` (e.g., `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `OVER()`)
- `CTEs` and subqueries

---

## 🔎 How to Use

1. Load the dataset into your SQL database
2. Run queries from the `/queries` folder
3. Export outputs (optional) into CSV or dashboard tools
4. Review insights in `/outputs`

---

## ✅ Project Status

- [x] Dataset loaded and cleaned  
- [x] Core SQL queries written  
- [ ] Dashboard visualization (optional)
